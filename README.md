### Description

This program is a word search program using a list of over 173,000 words, a listing called enable3 used in Scrabble tournaments. Some of the functions include searching by word (uses a hash search by Philippe Lord), prefix, suffix, wildcard, and several word list browses. The program also includes an unscramble function which will list all words that can be made from a letter set, with support for wildcards or blanks. A couple of searches are specifically targeted to be a help with playing Scrabble. This is my first submission!
